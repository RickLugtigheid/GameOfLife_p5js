## The rules
| Rule  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbours dies. |
| 2 | Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on to the next generation. |
| 3 | Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. |
| 4 | Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. |
